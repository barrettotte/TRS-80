## TRS-80
This repository is for exploring how to code in the TRS-80 environment.
I will briefly learn about LEVEL-II BASIC, Z80 Assembly, and 6809 Assembly.


I currently own the following machines:
* TRS-80 Model I (Untested)
* TRS-80 Model III (Bad PSU and CRT)
* TRS-80 Model 4P (Working)
* Tandy Color Computer 3 - CoCo 3 (Untested)


I will learn how to program on the TRS-80 Model 4P through an emulator (listed in sources) first.
Then, I will eventually pick a program to execute on the live machine and write to a 5.25in floppy.
